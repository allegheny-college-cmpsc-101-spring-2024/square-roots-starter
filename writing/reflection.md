# Square Root Computation

TODO: Provide responses for the TODOs.

Make sure that all aspects of the `writing/reflection.md` correctly use all
of the features of the Markdown standard. This means that, when you preview your
Markdown it should always be formatted in a suitable fashion. For VS Code previews,
right click on the tab that shows the file name (e.g. `reflection.md`), then select
Open Preview.

Please make sure that you completely delete the TODO markers
from every line of the `writing/reflection.md` file.

Ensure that your writing is original and based on your own understanding
of the concepts.

## Program Output

### Use two fenced code blocks to provide output from two different runs of `squareroot` with the same input

#### One output from running the exhaustive algorithm

TODO: Pick an input value and run it with the exhaustive algorithm
TODO: Provide the specific command that you ran
TODO: Use a fenced code block to provide the output for this command.
TODO: Please remember that the input of `25000` is only a suggestion;
you need to find a sufficiently large and representative input value for your program
such that you can judge the efficency, or lack thereof.

#### One output from running the efficient algorithm

TODO: Use the same input value as above and run it with the efficient algorithm
TODO: Provide the specific command that you ran
TODO: Use a fenced code block to provide the output for this command.

## Performance Analysis

TODO: Provide paragraph(s) that state which algorithm is fastest. Please make
sure that you reference your program output to explain the results. If there are
anomalies in your data sets produced by `squareroot` then make sure that you
explain them to the best of your ability, leveraging the content in the course
textbook and any online resources you want to reference. Importantly, you must
describe both (a) the trends in the data set and (b) why those trends are evident.

## Source Code

### Describe in detail how the completed source code works

#### A source code segment that performs profiling on `compute_square_root_exhaustive`

TODO: Use a fenced code block to provide the requested source code
TODO: Write at least one paragraph to explain the requested source code

#### The declaration of the default value of the `square_root_tuple`

TODO: Use a fenced code block to provide the requested source code
TODO: Write at least one paragraph to explain the requested source code
